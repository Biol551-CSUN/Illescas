# Illescas  
#### Greetings,  
My name is **_Sandy Illescas_** and I am a biology major at CSUN.  
This course has taught me a few things already, here are a list of a few:

1. I realized learning R requires constant practice
2. I can learn how to organize my data so it looks neat
3. **README** files are going to be handy down the road.

Once I have data, I will be able save it in my folder and provide a link to it like [this!](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Illescas/tree/main/Week_02/Data)  
Which makes me very smile...kinda like this.
